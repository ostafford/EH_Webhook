/**
 * Live read-only probe for the un-approve question behind the cron sweep (#7):
 * when an admin un-approves an Onboarding pack, does the Onboarding API move it
 * out of `status: "completed"` (back to "in_progress"), or does it keep
 * "completed" and only change `isWaitingApproval`?
 *
 * `diffAssignments` in src/cron/sweep.ts assumes the former. Run this between
 * each Connecteam UI action to confirm:
 *
 *   1. pack Approved      ->  npx vitest run test/onboarding-status.integration.test.ts
 *   2. un-approve it      ->  run again, compare
 *   3. re-approve it      ->  run again, compare
 *
 * Skipped unless CT_API_KEY is set (test/setup.env.ts loads it from .dev.vars).
 * Read-only: it only calls GET /onboarding/v1/packs/{id}/assignments.
