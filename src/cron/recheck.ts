/**
 * Daily EH-status recheck pass (issue #43). `src/cron/sweep.ts` and the queue
 * consumer only look at an employee at two moments: the pack first reaching
 * `completed`, and (via the `user_updated` webhook) a Connecteam profile edit.
 * Between those moments the integration is blind to EH - a record EH marks
 * `Incomplete` for admin-only reasons (pay-run defaults, award, ...) stays that
 * way in our view even after a payroll admin finishes it by hand in EH, and the
 * Manual-follow-up notice never learns it is resolved.
 *
 * This pass re-reads every employee whose last attempt ended in a
 * Manual-follow-up. It is read-only against EH: only `getByExternalId`, never
 * `upsertByExternalId` - it never touches a pay run. `getByExternalId` only
 * returns `status` ("Complete" | "Incomplete"), not the `detailedStatus` reason
 * phrase (that only comes back on a POST/PUT write envelope - confirmed
 * `docs/eh-complete-criteria.md`), so this pass can tell WHETHER a record is
 * still Incomplete but not WHY. That is fine for its one job:
 *
 *   - status no longer Incomplete -> the record resolved without a profile
 *     edit. Write a `resolved` sync_log row, flip `employee_map.last_outcome`
 *     off `follow_up` (so it drops out of the next recheck) and post a
 *     one-line resolved notice.
 *   - still Incomplete -> do nothing. A changed reason-set can only be told
 *     apart from an unchanged one via `detailedStatus`, which needs a write;
 *     surfacing a new admin reason stays the job of the next real sync
 *     (profile edit or approval), same as before this pass existed.
