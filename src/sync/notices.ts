/**
 * De-dup for notices that could otherwise repeat: the two admin-channel kinds
 * that repeat while a record sits `Incomplete` (issue #27) - a Manual-follow-up
 * notice and a System alert - plus the employee-facing Correction message,
 * which can repeat on a queue retry of the exact same job (no relation to #27).
 *
 * Connecteam fires one `user_updated` per changed field, so every real profile
 * edit re-runs the sync. The mapped-payload hash in `consumer.ts` only skips
 * byte-identical re-deliveries - a genuine edit changes the payload but can
 * leave the exact same follow-up reason in place ("Pay Run Defaults are
 * incomplete"), so the notice fires again. Observed: one user edited 3x in
 * ~90s while still Incomplete -> 3 identical notices in the channel.
 *
 * Fix: remember, in `sync_meta`, when each distinct notice last went out - keyed
 * by user AND a hash of its reason-set, so a notice whose reasons actually
 * changed (e.g. non-resident newly added) still posts. Same marker mechanism
 * the integrator system-alert de-dup already uses (src/index.ts); this one
 * guards the client's own alerts channel. One `sync_meta` row accumulates per
 * user per distinct reason-set - a few hundred at most for a single client, so
 * left unpruned; a `DELETE FROM sync_meta WHERE key LIKE 'notice:%' AND
 * num < <cutoff>` in the cron would clear them if it ever matters.
 *
 * The `correction` kind uses the same marker mechanism but a different key
 * ingredient on purpose: `consumer.ts` passes the mapped-payload hash, not the
 * decision's reasons. A genuine edit (even to an unrelated field) changes that
 * hash, so this guard never suppresses a fresh Correction cycle attempt - it
 * only catches a queue redelivery of the *exact same* job (a crash after the
 * DM went out but before the ack), which would otherwise re-DM the employee
 * and double-bump their failure-cycle count via `advanceCycle`.
