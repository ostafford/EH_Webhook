 *   2. Manual-follow-up notice  -> the admin channel.
 *   3. System alert             -> the admin channel.
 *   4. Success message          -> the employee, once on a first sync and once
 *      when a Correction is fixed (#71; per-client `messages.employeeSuccess`).
 *   5. Admin success notice     -> the admin channel, at the same two moments
 *      (per-client `messages.adminSuccess`).
 *
 * Messages to a person (1 and 4) end with a short "this is automated" note
 * (per-client `messages.automatedNote`), kept whole however long the rest runs.
 *
 * Employment Hero's raw error text is NEVER placed in a message - it goes to the
 * audit log only. Each recognised field maps to a curated, actionable line;
