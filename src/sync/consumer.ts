/**
 * The end-to-end sync for one queued job (issue #6). Given a Connecteam user id
 * it: resolves the user, maps them, upserts the Employment Hero record, reads it
 * back, runs {@link decide}, drives the failure-cycle state machine, sends any
 * message, and records the link + audit row. Replaying an old or unchanged event
 * is a no-op.
 *
 * Everything it touches is injected ({@link SyncDeps}) so it runs unchanged in a
 * unit test with fakes or in the Worker with real clients and D1. It never
 * throws for an expected retryable fault - it returns `status: "retry"` and lets
 * the queue handler call `message.retry()`.
 *
 * The queue retries a job up to 5 times, with a growing delay
 * ({@link retryDelaySeconds}), re-running it from the start. That is
 * only safe because every side effect below is idempotent (the EH upsert, the
 * link) or claimed before it happens (each message). A new side effect must be
 * one or the other - see docs/adr/0007. Every send's result is checked: a
 * failed one releases its claim and the job returns `status: "retry"` (#89).
