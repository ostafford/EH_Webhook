/**
 * Pure derivation of the sync-status roster (issue #44). Turns one joined row
 * (an `employee_map` record plus that person's latest `sync_log` row) into one
 * of four states an admin can act on:
 *
 *   - ready               EH reports the record Complete (our last decision was `ok`,
 *                          or the daily recheck pass, #43, found it resolved).
 *   - waiting_on_employee  the employee has an open Correction cycle.
 *   - waiting_on_admin     synced with safe defaults but EH still needs manual admin
 *                          setup (pay-run defaults, non-resident tax scale, SMSF, ...).
 *   - broken               a job for this person dead-lettered, or their sync landed
 *                          on an EH employee id already linked to a different
 *                          Connecteam user (an identity collision - see
 *                          SyncGateway.findByEhEmployeeId).
 *
 * `broken` is read off the LATEST sync_log row, not `employee_map.last_outcome` -
 * neither a dead-letter nor a collision is ever written to `employee_map` (see
 * handleDeadLetter and the collision check in sync/consumer.ts), so a person
 * whose very first-ever sync attempt hit either has no `employee_map` row at
 * all. `ROSTER_QUERY_SQL` starts from the UNION of both tables' ids so that
 * person still shows up here as `broken`.
 *
 * No employee VALUE ever reaches this module - only ids, the outcome enum, and
 * the redaction-safe strings already written by auditDetail() (sync/decide.ts).
