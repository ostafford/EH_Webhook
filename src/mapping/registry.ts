/**
 * Every client's field-map, bundled into the Worker. Workers have no filesystem
 * at runtime, so each map is a static import and ends up in the deploy bundle.
 *
 * DEFAULT: one repo clone serves one client, whose map is `clients/self/`. The
 * Worker loads `self` unless `FIELD_MAP_CLIENT` names another entry here.
 *
 * ADD ANOTHER CLIENT (multi-tenant only):
 *   1. create clients/<slug>/field-map.json
 *   2. add an import + one entry below
 *   3. set the deployment's FIELD_MAP_CLIENT var to <slug>
