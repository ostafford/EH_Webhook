# Connecteam → Employment Hero field checklist

Every Connecteam field the integration reads, what it becomes in Employment Hero
(EH), and how to fix it when it's missing. Use it to check a client's Connecteam
account before setup, and as the reference for the wizard's field check.

**Key**

| | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🔴 **Required** | The sync can't create the EH employee without it. The employee gets a Correction message asking them to fill it in. |
| 🟡 **Recommended** | The sync still works, but the EH record has a gap a payroll admin may have to fill by hand. |
| 🔵 **Admin-only** | Filled in by an admin, not the employee. |
| ⚪ **Not synced** | Read by the integration for its own logic, never sent to EH. |

> **Field names are flexible.** The names below are from the demo account.
> A client's fields can be called anything. The *field map* records which
> client field matches which EH field. What matters is that each piece of
> information is collected **somewhere in the onboarding pack**.

## 🪪 Identity

| | Connecteam field | Type | → EH field | Why EH needs it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 | Legal First Name | Text | First name | Legal name for the ATO, not the preferred name |
| 🔴 | Legal Surname | Text | Surname | Legal name for the ATO |
| 🔴 | Birthday | Date | Date of birth | Tax and super eligibility |
| 🟡 | Gender | Dropdown: Male / Female / Other | Gender | EH only records Male or Female, so `Other` is left blank in EH |
| 🟡 | *Email* (built into the profile) | — | Email | Payslips; no custom field needed |
| 🟡 | *Phone number* (built into the profile) | — | Mobile | No custom field needed |

> **Legal name, not profile name.** EH's first name and surname come from the
> **Legal First Name** and **Legal Surname** fields. The *First name* on the
> Connecteam profile is the employee's **preferred** name and is deliberately
> not synced, so changing it doesn't change payroll (#70).

## 🩺 Field check: what each result means and how to fix it

The wizard's field check (planned) reads the client's Connecteam fields and
gives each one a result:

| Result | Meaning | Why it matters | How to fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ **Found** | The field exists, is the right type, and is in the onboarding pack | — | Nothing to do |
| ❌ **Missing** | No matching field in Connecteam | 🔴 required: every employee gets a Correction message and isn't created in EH. 🟡 recommended: the EH record has a gap Create it with `npm run create-fields` (the wizard's Connecteam custom fields stage), then **add it to the onboarding pack** |
| ❌ **Not in the pack** | The field exists but is excluded from the onboarding pack | Employees are never asked for it, so it's always blank | Open the onboarding pack's settings in Connecteam and include the field |
| ⚠️ **Wrong type** | E.g. Birthday is a text field instead of a date | The value can't be converted, so the sync rejects it | Connecteam can't change a field's type, only rename or delete it. Create a new field of the right type, include it in the pack, and delete or rename the old one |
| ⚠️ **Dropdown options don't match** | E.g. Employee Status has `Full time` instead of `FullTime` | EH rejects anything it doesn't recognise | Rename the options to the exact values above, or map them in the field map |
| ⚠️ **Editable by employees** | The award field can be edited by the employee | An employee could pick their own pay classification | Set the field to admin-only |
| ⚠️ **No answers yet** | The field exists, but nobody has filled it in | Not an error for new fields. Existing approved employees will sync with this gap | Ask existing employees to complete the field, then re-approve |

## 🎓 Award setup (wizard stage)

Connecteam has no idea awards exist; EH does. The integration bridges this:

1. **The client installs their award(s) in EH.** This is a payroll decision, so it stays manual.
2. **The wizard checks** that EH has at least one award classification, and stops with a clear message if there are none.
3. **The wizard imports every classification** into a Connecteam admin-only dropdown (`npm run provision-classification-field`), and the Pay-run settings stage maps it.
4. **Admins pick each employee's classification** in Connecteam. The integration never chooses one.

**When an award changes in EH** (a new award, or an award review), re-run the
import. It only adds new classifications and never changes an employee's
existing selection:

```
npm run provision-classification-field
```
