# EH_Webhook

A reusable integration **template** that syncs employee-entered details (personal, contact, and payroll-sensitive: TFN, bank, super) from Connecteam into Employment Hero Payroll, so staff enter their details once (in Connecteam) rather than twice. Deployed once per client — each client gets an isolated Cloudflare Worker, D1, domain, and credential set; all client-specific values (IDs, field map) are external config, never code.

## Language

**EH** / **Employment Hero Payroll**:
The sync target. Specifically the Employment Hero Payroll product (formerly KeyPay / "payroll classic"), AU region — API base `https://api.yourpayroll.com.au/api/v2`, API-key auth, business identified by `businessId`.
_Avoid_: "Employment Hero" unqualified, EH HR platform, `api.employmenthero.com`, KeyPay (legacy name)

**Connecteam**:
The system of record where employees enter their own details. Source of the sync. Data lives in user profile fields (built-in + custom fields) and Onboarding packs.

**Sync**:
One-way propagation of an employee's details from Connecteam to EH, triggered by a Connecteam webhook. EH never writes back to Connecteam; the only return signal is a correction message (see Correction message).

**Employee record**:
The person's record in EH Payroll. Created or updated by the sync. Can exist in EH in an **Incomplete** state.

**Incomplete** (EH employee status):
EH Payroll's own status for an employee record that was created with less than the data EH needs to be payroll-ready. Minimum fields to create at all: first name, surname, start date, employment type, tax file number.

**Validation failure**:
The condition that triggers a correction message. Covers: EH rejects the write (**HTTP 400** with a `{ message: "Field: reason" }` body — e.g. a malformed BSB), or the resulting employee record stays **Incomplete**. Note EH does *not* reject a bad TFN at the API — it stores it and the record stays Incomplete, so a wrong TFN surfaces only through the Incomplete status, not a 400. The user's phrase "checksum verifies it's incorrect" refers to this whole condition.
_Avoid_: checksum, 422

**Correction message**:
One of three outbound message types. Sent to the **employee** who entered bad data (data that failed EH validation), as a DM from the Connecteam **custom publisher**. On the third failed Correction cycle it also goes to the employee's Direct manager.
_Avoid_: notification, alert

**Manual-follow-up notice**:
Second message type. Posted to the admin **channel**. For data that synced fine but needs a payroll admin to finish something in EH by hand: non-resident / working-holiday-maker tax scale, SMSF super, `INTERNATIONAL` address. The sync still completes with a safe default.

**System alert**:
Third message type. Posted to the admin **channel**. For failures the employee cannot fix — EH outage, auth failure, bugs — raised when a queue message dead-letters.

**Custom publisher**:
A Connecteam feature: a named non-human sender that the API can post chat messages as.

**Onboarding pack**:
A Connecteam Onboarding-feature assignment for one user, with fields split between user-completed and admin-completed. Every user always has one. States, and how the Onboarding API represents each:
- **In Progress** — `status: in_progress`, `isWaitingApproval: false`
- **Ready for review & approval** — `status: in_progress`, `isWaitingApproval: true`
- **Approved** (admin clicked "Approve Onboarding") — `status: completed`

The initial EH sync for a person fires when their assignment first reaches `status: completed`, detected by a 1-minute cron poll of the Onboarding API diffed against stored state (there is no approval webhook — see ADR-0002). After approval, further profile-field edits sync via the `user_updated` webhook.

**Correction cycle**:
One attempt to sync a user that ended in a Validation failure, plus the resulting Correction message. Cycles for a user do not auto-retry — the next attempt only happens when the user edits their Connecteam data again. First two cycles message the employee only; the third also messages their direct manager. The counter resets on a successful sync.

**Payroll ID** / **External ID**:
EH Payroll's `externalId` field on an employee (shown in the EH UI as "Payroll ID"). The sync sets it to the Connecteam `userId` and uses it as the cross-system match key. Email is only a fallback for the very first match.

**In-scope fields**:
Everything the employee can enter in the onboarding pack: personal, address, emergency contact, structural fields EH needs (name, start date, employment type, job title), **and** tax file number, bank account(s), superannuation, and tax-declaration answers. All flow Connecteam → EH via the API — no EH self-setup (see ADR-0001). Pay rate / award / classification stay a manual EH task for v1.

**EH self-setup**:
EH Payroll's `initiateselfservice` wizard. Considered and rejected — see ADR-0001. Not used.
